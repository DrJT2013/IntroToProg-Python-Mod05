# Change Log: (Who, When, What)
#   RRoot,1/1/2030,Created Script
#   Julianne Tillmann, 11/14/2024, Added the use of json, data processing using dictionaries
#   and exception handling.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ #

# Adding the ability to work with json files.
import json

# Define the Data Constants
MENU: str = '''
