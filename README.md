The fifth assignment in this course builds upon previous assignments by introducing dictionaries, JSON files, and structured error handling. The goal was to enhance the existing student registration program to use dictionaries for data storage, JSON files for persistence, and try-except blocks for error handling. This program registers students for courses, stores their data, displays current enrollments, saves data to a JSON file, and exits when prompted.
